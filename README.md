# MotionPlanning
The project in the folder RRT-Based-Quadrotor-BurningBuilding contains a novel technique to carry out path planning of a non-holonomic quadcopter, which has to escape a burning building. In addition to satisfying the non-holonomic constraints and finding the obstacle free optimal trajectory , the quadcopter has two options to choose from: going over fire if its not very dangerous, or take a longer route instead of going over the fire. How does the quadcopter accounts for each of these tasks?  


Please see the "Presentation" directory for the details about the algorithm. There is a slideshow "RRT-for-QuadROtor.ppt" and research paper "RRT-for-Non-Holonomic-QuadROtor.pdf". Also, in the "Presentation" directory, see the videos out-1.mp4 and out-2.mp4 for the final results simulated in Gazebo and ROS.
