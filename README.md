# MotionPlanning
The project in the folder RRT-Based-Quadrotor-BurningBuilding contains a novel technique to carry out path planning of a non-holonomic quadcopter, which has to escape a burning building. In addition to satisfying the non-holonomic constraints and finding the obstacle free optimal trajectory , the quadcopter has two options to choose from: going over fire if its not very dangerous, or take a longer route instead of going over the fire. How does the quadcopter accounts for each of these tasks?
